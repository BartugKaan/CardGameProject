# Sanctum Shadows
Sanctum Shadows is a dedicated card game that let the players fight against a 'Dark Priest'. As a developers, we aimed to design a turn-based card game. The game mechanics require the player to strategically evaluate the cards in their hand to defeat the enemy in front of them. This game was created for Gad2005 Final Project.

## Core Concepts
* Play cards right by thinking strategically
* Formulate a strategy by anticipating the NPC's next move

## Game Play
After the player plays the selected card, the NPC (non-player character) initiates an attack. Additionally, at the end of each turn, the player's hand is refreshed, requiring the player to strategically evaluate the new set of cards in their hand.
